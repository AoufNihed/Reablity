# 🔌 Reablity: Reliability Modeling & AI-driven Analysis  

## 📖 Overview  

Reablity is a **comprehensive system for analyzing and improving the reliability of electrical networks**. It integrates **classical models** (FTA, MTTR, Markov Chains) and **machine learning techniques** to assess **quality, stability, and continuity** of electrical grids.  

The project is designed to:  
✅ **Model classical reliability systems** using probabilistic methods.  
✅ **Enhance predictions with AI** (Random Forest, K-Means, Isolation Forest).  
✅ **Develop an intelligent multi-agent system** using CrewAI for **continuous, stable, and high-quality power supply**.  
✅ **Provide insightful data visualizations** for **failure detection & prevention**.
